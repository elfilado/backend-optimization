# Hex Game Optimization

The resolution of the hex game using several algorithms in different languages and analyze of the performance.

The main file consists of creating the Hex Game. Thus, there is an input grid that describes the game board with the pieces present.

The program then returns the graph representing each node and its distance to its neighbors. A call is then made to Dijkstra with the obtained graph, specifying a starting and ending node.
